<h1>Set up Scheduled Programs</h1>

One of the main benefits of LacunaWaX is that it allows you to schedule a number of common 
tasks.  You set up what you want those scheduled tasks to do using the main LacunaWaX GUI, 
but LacunaWaX itself does not schedule anything; you must set up your own schedule.
<p>

Schedule-able programs are found in <code>[% bin_dir %], and include:
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>Schedule_archmin.exe</code><br>
        <font size=-1>
            Handles both glyph pushing and automated searching of individual arch 
            mins
        </font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>Schedule_autovote.exe</code><br>
        <font size=-1>
            Votes for SS propositions based on your settings
        </font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>Schedule_lottery.exe</code><br>
        <font size=-1>
            Plays the lottery on your requested colonies
        </font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>Schedule_train_spies.exe</code><br>
        <font size=-1>
            Trains spies in the skills you've chosen provided the spies are both available 
            and currently sitting on a planet with the appropriate training building
        </font>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Actually setting up the schedule (Windows)</h2>

You can use the built-in Windows Task Scheduler if you want to, but if you're not used to 
it, it can be a horror show to try to figure out.
<p>

Instead, download and install <a href="http://www.splinterware.com/download/index.htm">System 
Scheduler Free</a> from Splinterware.  It's easier to use than the Windows scheduler and 
it will look the same across different versions of Windows, so you can just follow the 
instructions below step-by-step.
<p>

<strong>Preferences</strong><br>

<p>

After installing System Scheduler, you'll have a little alarm clock icon in 
your system tray (next to your clock).  Right-click it and chose 
"Preferences", then chose the Startup/Logging tab.
<p>

Make sure the "Do NOT start System Scheduler automatically on logon" checkbox 
is <em>unchecked!</em>  After you've made sure of that, you can close the 
preferences window.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<strong>Create new event</strong><br>
<img src="[%html_dir%]/images/ss-create-new.png">
<p>

Go back to the alarm clock icon in your systray again and just double-(left)-click it to 
bring up the actual scheduler.
<p>

You can see I have my Arch Min and Spy Training already set up, but I don't have Autovote 
set yet.  To set that up, click the indicated green circle icon to create a New Event.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
    
<strong>Name it and select the program to run</strong><br>
<img src="[%html_dir%]/images/ss-add-autovote.png">
<p>

Give your event a title, then click the yellow folder icon next to <em>Application</em>.  
Browse to your TMT Tools/LacunaWaX/bin/ folder and select "Schedule_autovote.exe".
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<strong>Make sure to run it Hidden</strong><br>
<img src="[%html_dir%]/images/ss-choose-hidden.png">
<p>

Make sure to select the "Hidden" State.  This will keep the black CMD window from popping 
up at you each time the scheduled event runs.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<strong>Choose times for it to run</strong><br>
<img src="[%html_dir%]/images/ss-autovote-every-three-hours.png">
<p>

I want my autovote to run every three hours.  So I selected "Every 
Hour/Selected Minutes" in the dropdown box up top.  Then, in the Hours 
box, I entered:
<blockquote><code>
    <b>00,03,06,09,12,15,18,21</b>
</code></blockquote>
Also, I typed <b>30</b> in the Minutes box, so my task will run at 
30 minutes past the hour, every three hours.
<p>

If you wanted your task to run every two hours, it would be:
<blockquote><code>
    <b>00,02,04,06,08,10,12,14,16,18,20,22</b>
</code></blockquote>
...etc
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<strong>Save</strong><br>
<img src="[%html_dir%]/images/ss-save.png">
<p>

Don't forget to save your new scheduled task by clicking the floppy icon.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<strong>Done!</strong><br>
<img src="[%html_dir%]/images/ss-complete.png">
<p>

And that's it - you can see my new scheduled task has been set up, and it displays the 
time when it'll run next.  You can now just close the System Scheduler window.
